                        <h1>My grit story part 1:</h1>
                        <p>When I was in the seventh grade, I went snowboarding with my family as we usually do during the winter. Me and my brother had been snowboarding for the entire afternoon. We found my mother and my sisters and told them that we were done for the day and were ready to leave whenever they were ready. They wanted to do 1 more run, so me and my brother left to go do 1 last run before we left for the day.

                    <h1>My grit story part 2:</h1>
                    <p>My brother went ahead of me, we started to carve the mountain. It was very icy on the mountain because it was hot yesterday and all the snow had melted and frozen during the night. Me and my brother race down the hill, going as fast as we could go, I was following him when the toe edge of my board catches on a massive ice patch and I go flying. I slide down the mountain on my back until I come to a stop. I take a little rest, and I try to stand up but find out that I can't stand anymore. </p>

                    <h1>My grit story part 3:</h1>
                    <p>I stay down for a little bit and take off my helmet with my left hand, I found out that my right arm cannot reach above my stomach. I'm old enough to understand that something is wrong, so I lay down and wait for help. At this time, my brother has probably already made it down the mountain. An older man comes to a stop next to me and asks if Im doing ok. I tell him that I think I broke something, he tells a lady next to him to go get help at the bottom of the mountain. He waited with me till the snowpatrol and my brother made it back up to me.</p>

                    <h1>My grit story part 4:</h1>
                    <p>before they came, I said a little prayer to my self that everything would be alright and that I would be able to return to school and complete all of my finals so that I wouldnt have to do summer school. When the snowpatrol looked at my shoulder, he said, "yea, thats broken for sure". He took me down the mountain in a sled. When we got to emergency care back in town, the doctors did an x-ray and were supprised to find out that it wasn't broken, I had just ripped a tendon, and would be making a faster recovery. </p>

                <p class="conclusion">After two weeks, I was able to return to school and complete my exams. My tendon is permenantly damaged and will not be repaired unless I choose to get surgery, which I will not because I already have full functionality of my arm. This experience can relate to the growth mindset portion of our class. I feel that even though I was going through this challenge, I was able to have a great growth mindset and do what I could, I focused on moving forward with my life and seeing what I could get done with this new disability, never not once stopping because I was ready to do more even with a ripped tendon.</p>
