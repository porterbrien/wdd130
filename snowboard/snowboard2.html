                    <h1>My grit story part 2:</h1>
                    <p>My brother went ahead of me, we started to carve the mountain. It was very icy on the mountain because it was hot yesterday and all the snow had melted and frozen during the night. Me and my brother race down the hill, going as fast as we could go, I was following him when the toe edge of my board catches on a massive ice patch and I go flying. I slide down the mountain on my back until I come to a stop. I take a little rest, and I try to stand up but find out that I can't stand anymore. </p>

                    <h1>My grit story part 3:</h1>
                    <p>I stay down for a little bit and take off my helmet with my left hand, I found out that my right arm cannot reach above my stomach. I'm old enough to understand that something is wrong, so I lay down and wait for help. At this time, my brother has probably already made it down the mountain. An older man comes to a stop next to me and asks if Im doing ok. I tell him that I think I broke something, he tells a lady next to him to go get help at the bottom of the mountain. He waited with me till the snowpatrol and my brother made it back up to me.</p>

                    <h1>My grit story part 4:</h1>
                    <p>before they came, I said a little prayer to my self that everything would be alright and that I would be able to return to school and complete all of my finals so that I wouldnt have to do summer school. When the snowpatrol looked at my shoulder, he said, "yea, thats broken for sure". He took me down the mountain in a sled. When we got to emergency care back in town, the doctors did an x-ray and were supprised to find out that it wasn't broken, I had just ripped a tendon, and would be making a faster recovery. </p>
