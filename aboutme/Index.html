        <h3>My name is Porter Brien</h3>
        <p> I was born and raised in Manhattan New York and lived there for 8 years. My family has since moved around and landed in Meridian Idaho where I have been living for the past 7 years. I have 6 members in my family, an older brother (20) two younger sisters (12 and 14) my father (53) my mother (51) and me (18). My major is Computer Science which I am enjoying at the moment, but it might change later, who knows. I love to snowboard and I've been doing it for 11 years now, I can't wait for winter, ima be a fiend on the slopes.ðŸ‘½</p>
